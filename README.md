## Intro

Due to the transparent nature of public blockchains, Decentralised Finance (Defi) assets are often subjected to monitoring and cybercrime. Investors and yield farmers risk losing competitive advantages by having their transactions monitored, techniques reverse engineered, and getting front run. 
SecureSwap protocol is here to help. We offer our users with swappable, collateralized anonymized digital assets that utilizes state of the art blockchain technology. 
With an innovative “Privacy Price” discovery system, users may create zero knowledge digital assets by depositing crypto from any blockchain into SecureSwap vaults and utilising them in a variety of DeFi apps within the ecosystem.

### Features

💳 SecureSwap Wallet </br>
SecureSwap Wallet is a browser-based privacy-enhanced wallet. It prevents the recycling of addresses, enables private connections to Binance DeFi, and is used for voting on governance. </br>
💱 Liquidity Providers </br>
Liquidity Providers, also known as Privacy miners, are rewarded in SecureSwap tokens for providing privacy wrapping for SecureSwap Protocol to anonymize transactions and assets. </br>
✊ SecureSwap Smart Contract </br>
Autonomous, Non-Custodial smart contracts act as decentralized custodians for collateralization of digital assets. </br>
🤖 Price Oracle </br>
The marginal price offered by SecureSwap (not including fees) can be computed by dividing the reserves of asset a by the reserves of asset b. Since arbitrageurs will trade with SecureSwap if this price is incorrect (by a sufficient amount to make up for the fee), the price offered by SecureSwap tends to track the relative market price of the assets. This means it can be used as an approximate price oracle. </br>
