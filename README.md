### Features

💳 SecureSwap Wallet
SecureSwap Wallet is a browser-based privacy-enhanced wallet. It prevents the recycling of addresses, enables private connections to Binance DeFi, and is used for voting on governance.
💱 Liquidity Providers
Liquidity Providers, also known as Privacy miners, are rewarded in SecureSwap tokens for providing privacy wrapping for SecureSwap Protocol to anonymize transactions and assets.
✊ SecureSwap Smart Contract
Autonomous, Non-Custodial smart contracts act as decentralized custodians for collateralization of digital assets.
🤖 Price Oracle
The marginal price offered by SecureSwap (not including fees) can be computed by dividing the reserves of asset a by the reserves of asset b. Since arbitrageurs will trade with SecureSwap if this price is incorrect (by a sufficient amount to make up for the fee), the price offered by SecureSwap tends to track the relative market price of the assets. This means it can be used as an approximate price oracle.
